### Manner of election of the president

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> As far as practicable, there shall be uniformity in the scale of representation of the different states at the election of the president.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> For the purpose of securing such uniformity among the states inter se as well as parity between the states as a whole and the union, the number of votes that each elected member of parliament and of the legislative assembly of each state is entitled to cast at such an election shall be determined in the following manner:
    1. Every elected member of the legislative assembly of a state shall have as many votes as there are multiples of one thousand in the quotient obtained by dividing the population of the state by the total number of the elected members of the assembly;
    2. If, after taking the said multiples of one thousand, the remainder is not less than five hundred, then the vote of each member referred to in sub-clause (a) shall be further increased by one;
    3. Each elected member of either house of parliament shall have such number of votes as may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of the legislative assemblies of the states under sub-clauses (a) and (b) by the total number of the elected members of both houses of parliament, fractions exceeding one-half being counted as one and other fractions being disregarded.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> The election of the president shall be held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, and the voting at such an election shall be by secret ballot.
