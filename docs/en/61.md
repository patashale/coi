### Procedure for impeaching the president

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> When a president is to be impeached for violation of the constitution, the charge shall be preferred by either house of parliament.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> No such charge shall be preferred unless:
    1. The proposal to prefer such charges is contained in a resolution that has been moved after at least fourteen days written notice signed by not less than one-fourth of the total number of members of the house, and
    2. Such a resolution has been passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the house.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> When a charge has been so preferred by either house of parliament, the other house shall investigate the charge or cause the charge to be investigated, and the president shall have the right to appear and to be represented at such an investigation.
4. <div style="text-align: justify"> If, as a result of the investigation, a resolution is passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the house by which the charge was investigated or caused to be investigated, declaring that the charge preferred against the president has been sustained, such a resolution shall have the effect of removing the president from the office as of the date on which the resolution is so passed.
