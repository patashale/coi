### The power of the president to promulgate ordinances during the recess of parliament

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> If at any time, except when both houses of parliament are in session, the president is satisfied that circumstances exist that render it necessary to take immediate action, the president may promulgate such ordinances as the circumstances appear to require.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> An ordinance promulgated under this article shall have the same force and effect as an act of parliament, but every such ordinance:
    1. shall be laid before both houses of parliament and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of parliament, or, if before the expiration of that period resolutions disapproving it are passed by both houses, upon the passing of the second of those resolutions; and
    2. It may be withdrawn at any time by the president.

        Where the houses of parliament are summoned to reassemble on different dates, the period of six weeks shall be reckoned from the later of those dates for this clause.

3. <div style="text-align: justify"> If and so far as an ordinance under this article makes any provision that parliament would not, under this constitution, be competent to enact, it shall be void.
