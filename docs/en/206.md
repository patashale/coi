### Votes on account, votes of credit and exceptional grants

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this chapter, the legislative assembly of a state shall have the power:
    1. to make any grant in advance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part of any financial year pending the completion of the procedure prescribed in Article 203 for the voting of such grant and the passing of the law under the provisions of Article 204 for that expenditure;
    2. to make a grant for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of the state when, on account of the magnitude or the indefinite character of the service, the demand cannot be stated with the details ordinarily given in an annual financial statement;
    3. to make an exceptional grant that forms no part of the current service of any financial year;
    and the Legislature of the State shall have the power to authorise by law the withdrawal of money from the Consolidated Fund of the State for the purposes for which the said grants are made.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> The provisions of articles 203 and 204 shall affect the making of any grant under clause (1) and any law to be made under that clause as they have an effect on the making of a grant concerning any expenditure mentioned in the annual financial statement and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of money out of the consolidated fund of the state to meet such expenditure.
