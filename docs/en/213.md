### The power of the governor to promulgate ordinances during the recess of the legislature

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> If at any time, except when the legislative assembly of a state is in session or where there is a legislative council in a state, except when both houses of the legislature are in session, the governor is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action, the governor may promulgate such ordinances as the circumstances appear to require, provided that the governor shall not, without instructions from the president, promulgate any such ordinance if:
    1. a bill containing the same provisions would, under this constitution, have required the previous sanction of the president for the introduction thereof into the legislature; or
    2. the governor would have deemed it necessary to reserve a bill containing the same provisions for the consideration of the president; or
    3. an act of the legislature of the state containing the same provisions would, under this constitution, have been invalid unless it had been reserved for the consideration of the president and received the assent of the president.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> An ordinance promulgated under this article shall have the same force and effect as an act of the legislature of the state assented to by the governor, but every such ordinance:
    1. shall be laid before the legislative assembly of the state, or where there is a legislative council in the state, before both houses, and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the legislature, or if before the expiration of that period a resolution disapproving it is passed by the legislative assembly and agreed to by the legislative council, if any, upon the passing of the resolution or, as the case may be, on the resolution being agreed to by the council; and
    2. may be withdrawn at any time by the governor.

        ??? info "Explanation"
            Where the Houses of the legislature of a state having a legislative council are summoned to reassemble on different dates, the period of six weeks shall be reckoned from the later of those dates for this clause.

3. <div style="text-align: justify"> If and so far as an ordinance under this article makes any provision that would not be valid if enacted in an act of the legislature of the state assented to by the governor, it shall be void, provided that, for the provisions of this constitution relating to the effect of an act of the legislature of a state that is repugnant to an act of parliament or an existing law concerning a matter enumerated in the concurrent list, an ordinance promulgated under this article in pursuance of instructions from the president shall be deemed to be an act of the legislature of the state that has been reserved for the consideration of the president and assented to by the president.
