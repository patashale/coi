### Transfer of certain cases to the high court
<div style="text-align: justify">

If the high court is satisfied that a case pending in a court subordinate to it involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this constitution, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, it shall withdraw the case and may:

</div>

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> either dispose of the case itself or
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> determine the said question of law and return the case to the court from which the case has been so withdrawn together with a copy of its judgement on such question, and the said court shall, on receipt thereof, proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgement.
