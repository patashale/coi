### Voting in houses, power of houses to act notwithstanding vacancies and quorum

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Save as otherwise provided in this constitution, all questions at any sitting of a house of the legislature of a state shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting, other than the speaker, chairman, or person acting as such.
    </p>

    The speaker, chairman, or person acting as such shall not vote in the first instance but shall have and exercise a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.

2. <div style="text-align: justify"> A house of the legislature of a state shall have the power to act notwithstanding any vacancy in the membership thereof, and any proceedings in the legislature of a state shall be valid notwithstanding that it is discovered subsequently that some person who was not entitled to do so sat, voted, or otherwise took part in the proceedings.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> Until the legislature of the state by law otherwise provides, the quorum to constitute a meeting of a house of the legislature of a state shall be ten members or one-tenth of the total number of members of the house, whichever is greater.
4. <div style="text-align: justify"> If at any time during a meeting of the legislative assembly or the legislative council of a state there is no quorum, it shall be the duty of the speaker, chairman, or person acting as such, either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.
