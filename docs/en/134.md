### Appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court regarding criminal matters

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> An appeal shall lie to the supreme court from any judgement, final order, or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a high court in the territory of India if the high court:
    1. has, on appeal, reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced to death; or
    2. has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any court subordinate to its authority and has, in such a trial, convicted the accused person and sentenced to death; or
    3. certifies under Article 134A that the case is a fit one for appeal to the supreme court, provided that an appeal under sub-clause (c) shall lie subject to such provisions as may be made in that behalf under clause (1) of Article 145 and to such conditions as the high court may establish or require.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Parliament may by law confer on the supreme court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgement, final order, or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a high court in the territory of India, subject to such conditions and limitations as may be specified in such law.
