### Bills reserved for consideration
<div style="text-align: justify">

When a bill is reserved by a governor for the consideration of the president, the president shall declare assent to the bill or withholds assent therefrom, provided that, where the bill is not a money bill, the president may direct the governor to return the bill to the house or, as the case may be, the houses of the legislature of the state together with such a message as is mentioned in the first proviso to Article 200, and, when a bill is so returned, the house or houses shall reconsider it accordingly within a period of six months from the date of receipt of such message, and, if it is again passed by the house or houses with or without amendment, it shall be presented again to the president for president's consideration.
