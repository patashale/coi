### Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles
<div style="text-align: justify">

Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the state towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in part 4 shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, takes away, or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14 or 19;Â and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy; provided that where such a law is made by the legislature of a state, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such a law, having been reserved for the consideration of the president, has received his assent.
