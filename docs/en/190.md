### Vacation of seats

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> No person shall be a member of both houses of the legislature of a state, and provision shall be made by the legislature of the state by law for the vacation from one of the houses of a person who is chosen a member of both houses of the legislature of the state.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> No person shall be a member of the legislatures of two or more states specified in Schedule 1, and if a person is chosen a member of the legislatures of two or more such states, then, at the expiration of such a period as may be specified in rules made by the president, that person's seat in the legislatures of all such states shall become vacant, unless the person has previously resigned the seat in the legislatures of all but one of the states.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> If a member of the house of the legislature of a state:
    1. becomes subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) or clause (2) of Article 191; or
    2. resigns the seat by writing and hand-addressing it to the speaker or the chairman, as the case may be, and the resignation is accepted by the speaker or the chairman, as the case may be, the seat shall thereupon become vacant, provided that in the case of any resignation referred to in sub-clause (b), if, from information received or otherwise and after making such inquiry as they think fit, the speaker or the chairman, as the case may be, is satisfied that such resignation is not voluntary or genuine, they shall not accept such resignation.
4. <div style="text-align: justify"> If, for a period of sixty days, a member of a house of the legislature of a state is absent from all meetings thereof without permission of the house, the house may declare the seat vacant, provided that in computing the said period of sixty days, no account shall be taken of any period during which the House is prorogued or is adjourned for more than four consecutive days.
