1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this chapter, the Lok Sabha shall have the power:
    1. to make any grant in advance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part of any financial year pending the completion of the procedure prescribed in Article 113 for the voting of such grant and the passing of the law by the provisions of Article 114 to that expenditure;
    2. to make a grant for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of India when, on account of the magnitude or indefinite character of the service, the demand cannot be stated with the details ordinarily given in an annual financial statement;
    3. to make an exceptional grant that forms no part of the current service of any financial year, and parliament shall have the power to authorise by law the withdrawal of money from the consolidated fund of India for the purposes for which the said grants are made.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> The provisions of articles 113 and 114 shall have an effect on the making of any grant under clause (1) and on any law to be made under that clause as they affect the making of a grant concerning any expenditure mentioned in the annual financial statement and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of money out of the consolidated fund of India to meet such expenditure.
