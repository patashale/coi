### Assent to bills
<div style="text-align: justify">

When a bill has been passed by the legislative assembly of a state or, in the case of a state having a legislative council, has been passed by both houses of the legislature of the state, it shall be presented to the governor, and the governor shall declare assent to the bill, withhold assent therefrom, or reserve the bill for the consideration of the president:
</p>

Provided that the governor may, as soon as possible after the presentation to the governor of the bill for assent, return the bill if it is not a money bill together with a message requesting that the house or houses will reconsider the bill or any specified provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as the governor may recommend in a message, and, when a bill is so returned, the house or houses shall reconsider the bill accordingly, and if the bill is passed again by the house or houses with or without amendment and presented to the governor for assent therefrom:
</p>

Provided further that the governor shall not assent to, but shall reserve for the consideration of the president, any bill that, in the opinion of the governor, if it became law, would so derogate from the powers of the high court as to endanger the position that that court is by this constitution designed to fill.
