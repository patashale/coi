### Jurisdiction and powers of the federal court under existing law are exercisable by the supreme court
<div style="text-align: justify">

Until parliament by law otherwise provides, the supreme court shall also have jurisdiction and powers to any matter to which the provisions of Article 133 or Article 134 do not apply if jurisdiction and powers concerning that matter were exercisable by the federal court immediately before the commencement of this constitution under any existing law.
