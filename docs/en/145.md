    3. rules as to the proceedings in the court for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by part 3;
    4. rules as to the proceedings in the court under Article 139A;
    5. rules as to the entertainment of appeals under sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of Article 134;
    6. rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgement pronounced or order made by the court may be reviewed and the procedure for such review, including the time within which applications to the court for such review are to be entered;
    7. rules as to the costs of and incidental to any proceedings in the court and as to the fees to be charged in respect of proceedings therein;

2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Subject to the provisions of clause (3), rules made under this article may fix the minimum number of judges who are to sit for any purpose and may provide for the powers of single judges and division courts.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> The minimum number of judges who are to sit to decide any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this constitution or to hear any reference under Article 143 shall be five: provided that, where the court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this chapter other than Article 132 consists of less than five judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this constitution, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such court shall refer the question for opinion to a court constituted as required by this clause to decide any case involving such a question and shall, on receipt of the opinion, dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.
4. <div style="text-align: justify"> No judgement shall be delivered by the supreme court save in open court, and no report shall be made under Article 143 save by an opinion also delivered in open court.
5. <div style="text-align: justify"> No judgement or such opinion shall be delivered by the supreme court save with the concurrence of a majority of the judges present at the hearing of the case, but nothing in this clause shall be deemed to prevent a judge who does not concur from delivering a dissenting judgement or opinion.
