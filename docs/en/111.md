### Assent to bills
<div style="text-align: justify">

When a bill has been passed by the houses of parliament, it shall be presented to the president, and the president shall declare assent to the bill or withhold assent therefrom:

</p>

Provided that, as soon as possible after the presentation to the president of a bill for assent, return the bill if it is not a money bill to the houses with a message requesting that they reconsider the bill or any specified provisions thereof and in particular consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as the president may recommend in the message, and when a bill is so returned, the houses shall reconsider the bill accordingly, and if the bill is passed again by the houses with or without amendment and presented to the president, the president shall not withhold assent therefrom.
