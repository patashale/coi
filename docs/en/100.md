### Voting in houses, power of houses to act notwithstanding vacancies and quorum

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Save as otherwise provided in this constitution, all questions at any sitting of either house or joint sitting of the Houses shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting, other than the speaker or person acting as chairperson or speaker. The chairperson, speaker, or person acting as such shall not vote in the first instance but shall have and exercise a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Either house of parliament shall have power to act notwithstanding any vacancy in the membership thereof, and any proceedings in parliament shall be valid notwithstanding that it is discovered subsequently that some person who was not entitled to do so sat, voted, or otherwise took part in the proceedings.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> Until parliament by law otherwise provides, the quorum to constitute a meeting of either house of parliament shall be one-tenth of the total number of members of the house.
4. <div style="text-align: justify"> If at any time during a meeting of a house there is no quorum, it shall be the duty of the chairperson, speaker, or person acting as such, either to adjourn the house or to suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.
