### Composition of the Lok Sabha

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Subject to the provisions of Article 331, the Lok Sabha shall consist of:
    1. not more than five hundred and thirty members chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the states; and
    2. not more than twenty members to represent the union territories, chosen in such manner as parliament may by law provide.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> For sub-clause (a) of clause (1):
    1. There shall be seats allotted to each state in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and the population of the state is, so far as practicable, the same for all states; and
    2. Each state shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is, so far as practicable, the same throughout the state; provided that the provisions of sub-clause (a) of this clause shall not apply for allotment of seats in the Lok Sabha to any state so long as the population of that state does not exceed six million.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> In this article, the expression "population" means the population as ascertained at the last preceding census for which the relevant figures have been published. Provided that the reference in this clause to the last preceding census for which the relevant figures have been published shall, until the relevant figures for the first census taken after the year 2026 have been published, be construed:
    1. for sub-clause (a) of clause (2) and the proviso to that clause, as a reference to the 1971 census; and
    2. for sub-clause (b) of clause (2), as a reference to the 2001 census.
