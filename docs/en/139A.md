### Transfer of certain cases

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Where cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of law are pending before the supreme court and one or more high courts or before two or more high courts and the supreme court is satisfied on its motion or an application made by the Attorney-General of India or by a party to any such case that such questions are substantial questions of general importance, the supreme court may withdraw the case or cases pending before the high court or the high courts and dispose of all the cases itself:

</p>

Provided that the supreme court may, after determining the said questions of law, return any case so withdrawn together with a copy of its judgement on such questions to the high court from which the case has been withdrawn, and the high court shall, on receipt thereof, proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgement.

2. <div style="text-align: justify"> The supreme court may if it deems it expedient to do so for the ends of justice, transfer any case, appeal, or other proceeding pending before any high court to any other high court.
