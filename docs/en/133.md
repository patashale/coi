### Appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court in appeals from high courts regarding civil matters

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> An appeal shall lie to the supreme court from any judgement, decree, or final order in a civil proceeding of a high court in the territory of India if the high court certifies under Article 134A:
    1. that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance; and
    2. that, in the opinion of the high court, the said question needs to be decided by the supreme court.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Notwithstanding anything in Article 132, any party appealing to the supreme court under clause (1) may urge as one of the grounds in such an appeal that a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this constitution has been wrongly decided.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> Notwithstanding anything in this article, no appeal shall, unless parliament by law otherwise provides, lie to the supreme court from the judgement, decree, or final order of one judge of a high court.
