### Power of the high courts to issue certain writs

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Notwithstanding anything in Article 32, every high court shall have power, throughout the territories to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including, in appropriate cases, any government within those territories, directions, orders, or writs, including writs like habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders, or writs to any government, authority, or person may also be exercised by any high court exercising jurisdiction concerning the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such government or authority or the residence of such person is not within those territories.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner, is made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without:
    1. furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all documents in support of the plea for such interim order; and
    2. giving such party an opportunity of being heard, making an application to the high court for the vacation of such order and furnishing a copy of such application to the party in whose favour such order has been made or the counsel of such party, the high court shall dispose of the application within a period of two weeks from the date on which it is received or from the date on which the copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is later, or where the high court is closed on the last day of that period, before the expiry of the next day afterwards on which the high court is open; and if the application is not so disposed of, the interim order shall, on the expiry of that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the said next day, stand vacated.
4. <div style="text-align: justify"> The power conferred on a high court by this article shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the supreme court by clause (2) of Article 32.
