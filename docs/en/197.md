    3. The bill is passed by the council with amendments to which the legislative assembly does not agree; the legislative assembly may, subject to the rules regulating its procedure, pass the bill again in the same or any subsequent session with or without such amendments, if any, as have been made, suggested or agreed to by the legislative council and then transmit the bill as so passed to the legislative council.
