### Control over subordinate courts
<div style="text-align: justify">

The control over district courts and courts subordinate thereto, including the posting and promotion of, and the grant of leave to, persons belonging to the judicial service of a state and holding any post inferior to the post of a district judge, shall be vested in the high court, but nothing in this article shall be construed as taking away from any such person any right of appeal which the person may have under the law regulating the conditions of their service or as authorising the high court to deal with the person otherwise than by the conditions of their service prescribed under such law.
