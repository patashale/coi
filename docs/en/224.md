### Appointment of additional and acting judges

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> If, because of any temporary increase in the business of a high court or because of arrears of work therein, it appears to the president that the number of judges of that court should be for the time being increased, the president may, in consultation with the National Judicial Appointments Commission, appoint duly qualified persons to be additional judges of the court for such a period not exceeding two years as the president may specify.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> When any judge of a high court other than the chief justice is, because of absence or for any other reason, unable to perform the duties of the office or is appointed to act temporarily as chief justice, the president may, in consultation with the National Judicial Appointments Commission, appoint a duly qualified person to act as a judge of that court until the permanent judge has resumed the duties.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> No person appointed as an additional or acting judge of a high court shall hold office after attaining the age of sixty-two years.
