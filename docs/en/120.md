### Language to be used in parliament

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Notwithstanding anything in Part 17, but subject to the provisions of Article 348, business in parliament shall be transacted in Hindi or English, provided that the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, speaker of the Lok Sabha, or person acting as such, as the case may be, may permit any member who cannot adequately express himself in Hindi or in English to address the house in the member's mother tongue.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Unless parliament by law otherwise provides, this article shall, after the expiration of a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this constitution, have effect as if the words "or in English" were omitted therefrom.
