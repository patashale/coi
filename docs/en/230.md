### Extension of jurisdiction of the high courts to union territories

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Parliament may by law extend the jurisdiction of a high court to, or exclude the jurisdiction of a high court from, any union territory.
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Where the high court of a state exercises jurisdiction in relation to a union territory,
    1. nothing in this constitution shall be construed as empowering the legislature of the state to increase, restrict, or abolish that jurisdiction; and
    2. Â the reference in Article 227 to the governor shall, in relation to any rules, forms, or tables for subordinate courts in that territory, be construed as a reference to the president.
