> Note: We will add more Indian languages with the same style of logo when there is a requirement and enough contributors who can write, validate content in their language, and approve the grammar used.
>
> At the moment, we don't have knowledge of other Indian languages or can be sure if the translation is accurate; hence, we do not want to hurt the sentiment of other Indian language-speaking people, so we abstain from posting the logos and contents.
